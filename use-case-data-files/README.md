# IBM  Concert: Use case data files

Concert sample data files serve as reference materials to guide users in adhering to the correct format when uploading files to the Concert application. These sample files are primarily provided as links within the Concert documentation for users' convenience.

## Usage

Files are organized by Concert release versions. Users can select and upload sample files from their chosen version in Concert's UI to observe how Concert evaluates the application's topology, identifying and assessing potential risks, including the impact of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).
