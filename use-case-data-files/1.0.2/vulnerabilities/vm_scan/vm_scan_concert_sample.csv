CVE-2022-21476,10.10.10.10,h2,,,high,7.8,Y,,"The web-based admin console in H2 Database Engine through 2.1.214 can be started via the CLI with the argument -webAdminPassword, which allows the user to specify the password in cleartext for the web admin console. Consequently, a local user (or an attacker that has obtained local access through some means) would be able to discover the password by listing processes and their arguments. NOTE: the vendor states 'This is not a vulnerability of H2 Console ... Passwords should never be passed on the command line and every qualified DBA or system administrator is expected to know that.'",ip-10-10-10-10.ec2.internal
CVE-2022-42003,10.10.10.10,derby,,,critical,9.8,Y,,"The org.h2.util.JdbcUtils.getConnection method of the H2 database takes as parameters the class name of the driver and URL of the database. An attacker may pass a JNDI driver name and a URL leading to a LDAP or RMI servers, causing remote code execution. This can be exploited through various attack vectors, most notably through the H2 Console which leads to unauthenticated remote code execution.",ip-10-10-10-10.ec2.internal
CVE-2023-40217,10.01.11.22,hsqldb,,,high,7,Y,,"pgjdbc is the offical PostgreSQL JDBC Driver. A security hole was found in the jdbc driver for postgresql database while doing security research. The system using the postgresql library will be attacked when attacker control the jdbc url or properties. pgjdbc instantiates plugin instances based on class names provided via `authenticationPluginClassName`, `sslhostnameverifier`, `socketFactory`, `sslfactory`, `sslpasswordcallback` connection properties. However, the driver did not verify if the class implements the expected interface before instantiating the class. This can lead to code execution loaded via arbitrary classes. Users using plugins are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",ip-10-01-11-22.ec2.internal
CVE-2022-23305,10.01.11.22,hsqldb,,,high,8.8,Y,,SQLite JDBC is a library for accessing and creating SQLite database files in Java. Sqlite-jdbc addresses a remote code execution vulnerability via JDBC URL. This issue impacting versions 3.6.14.1 through 3.41.2.1 and has been fixed in version 3.41.2.2.,ip-10-01-11-22.ec2.internal
