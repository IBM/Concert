# concert-utils

This repo includes a set of Concert utility scripts that facilitate exploiting the capabilities of a Concert Toolkit image.  The scripts are organized in different directories in terms of the script exploitation context.

Scripts in the `helpers` directory are described in `ConcertUtils_Guide.md`.  All types of Concert supported files can be uploaded to a Concert service instance via `concert_upload.sh`. For each type of Concert supported files, there is a script that converts a YAML-formated ConcertDef file to a JSON-formatted one.  All the scripts run a Concert Toolkit image to complete their respecitve tasks.
