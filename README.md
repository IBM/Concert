# Concert

IBM Concert is automated IT resilience. It helps technology leaders, application owners, SREs, and development teams eliminate manual effort, reduce risks, and boost productivity, enabling organizations to operate with greater confidence, agility, and control. Built on agentic AI, Concert unifies and correlates siloed data from your existing tools, automatically contextualizes and recommends actions to resolve key issues, and can be configured to take actions to remediate issues automatically.

Concert automates resilience best practices while providing audit-ready evidence to help you remain continuously compliant, so teams can be more focused on supporting the business.
