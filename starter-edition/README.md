# IBM  Concert developer package for virtual machine


IBM速 Concert provides a package with a set of containerized services that you can run on a Linux machine. The package includes scripts and utilities for you to set up and operate the Concert services.

The virtual machine deployment is intended for starter use cases, and for ease of deployment and management.  With the single node installation, resiliency is limited and host node failures will result in Concert being inaccessible. Enterprise features such as Identity Provider integration is not supported in this configuration and may only be suitable for non-production use.
